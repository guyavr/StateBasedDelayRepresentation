Simulation codes for the paper: State-Based Delay Representation and Its Transfer from a Game of Pong to Reaching and Tracking

The attached .m files the simulations movements according to different delay representation models.
To run the simulations, run the following files:
Experiment1_Reaching - simulations of the reaching task in experiment 1 (Figure 4c in the paper)
Experiment3_Tracking - simulations of the tracking task in experiment 3 (Figure 7 in the paper)
Experiment4_Tracking - simulations of the tracking task in experiment 4 (Figure 9 in the paper)
Experiment4_Pong - simulations of the pong task in experiment 4 (Figure 11c in the paper)
